**WHAT IS TIC TAC TOE?**
----------------------------
Tic-tac-toe, noughts and crosses,
or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players,
X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. 
The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks 
in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

**ABOUT MY GAME**
------------------
It's a quick game I made in Python 3 to practice the things
I've learnt about the language. Game is played by 2 people
and currently only local co-op on the same PC. There will
be more updates in the future and probably a C# port to make
the game more appealing, and maybe add online and AI features.

**HOW TO PLAY**
It's pretty simple, as the game asks you everything needed
before you make your move. Upper left square is number 1, and
lower right square is number 9 (so It's the reverse of numpad).
Currently, It announces winners by their marks, not names.
